# Obtaining the Log File

In this section, we will provide instructions on how to obtain the log file generated by the project, which includes records of completed orders, stock movements, sent emails, and errors.

## Log File Location

The log file is located in the root directory of the project and is named  [logfile.txt](../logfile.txt).

## Viewing the Log File

You can view the log file using a text editor or a log visualization tool such as [Log4j Viewer](https://link-to-log4j-viewer).

## Backing Up the Log File

It is a good practice to create regular backups of the log file, especially if it contains critical information. Make sure to store copies of the log file in a secure location.
